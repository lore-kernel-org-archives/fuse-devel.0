"...the fuse server author needing to adapt..."

Everything below here looked ok to me, though I admit that there's a lot
of documentation so I may have missed some fine details.

> +The two entry points
> +--------------------
> +
> +There are two ways to write the server, mirroring the normal libfuse APIs:
> +
> +  - High-level API: do the service setup, then call fuse_service_main(), the
> +    service-aware counterpart of fuse_main(). See example/service_hl.c.
> +
> +  - Low-level API: do the service setup, create the session yourself, call
> +    fuse_service_session_mount(), and run your own event loop. See
> +    example/service_ll.c.
> +
> +Both share the same startup, resource-request, and shutdown sequence.
> +
> +IMPORTANT: define FUSE_USE_VERSION to at least FUSE_MAKE_VERSION(3, 19) and
> +include <fuse_service.h>. Do NOT call fuse_daemonize(): a service must stay in
> +the foreground so systemd can track it (fuse_service_session_mount and
> +fuse_service_main arrange this for you). Service mounts do not support
> +synchronous FUSE_INIT yet: FUSE_INIT reaches the server only after
> +fuservicemount3 has performed the mount. Do not call
> +fuse_daemonize_early_start() either.
> +
> +

> +
> +
> +Startup sequence
> +----------------
> +
> +The first thing main() does is accept the service context:
> +
> +    struct fuse_service *service;
> +
> +    if (fuse_service_accept(&service))
> +        goto error;                 /* socket/handshake failure */
> +
> +    if (!fuse_service_accepted(service))
> +        goto error;                 /* not started as a service */
> +
> +fuse_service_accept() looks for the socket handed to the process by systemd,
> +performs the protocol handshake, and receives the argument vector and the
> +/dev/fuse fd. It always initialises *service; use fuse_service_accepted() to
> +find out whether the program is actually running as a service (it returns
> +false, with *service == NULL, when there is no service socket).
> +
> +The example servers require a service and exit otherwise (their error paths
> +run only once the context is valid). A server that also wants to support
> +traditional invocation can branch on fuse_service_accepted() and fall back to
> +fuse_main() / fuse_session_mount(); in that case do not call the other
> +fuse_service_* functions, which assume a valid service context.
> +
> +Next, fold the service-supplied arguments into the fuse_args built from the
> +argc and argv of main(), and parse them:
> +
> +    struct fuse_args args = FUSE_ARGS_INIT(argc, argv);
> +
> +    if (fuse_service_append_args(service, &args))   /* add helper's args */
> +        goto error;
> +
> +    if (fuse_opt_parse(&args, &priv, my_opts, my_opt_proc))   /* your opts */
> +        goto error;
> +
> +For the low-level API also extract the common command-line options:
> +
> +    struct fuse_cmdline_opts opts = { };
> +
> +    if (fuse_service_parse_cmdline_opts(&args, &opts))
> +        goto error;
> +
> +fuse_service_parse_cmdline_opts() is the service-mount analogue of
> +fuse_parse_cmdline(). It does NOT validate the mountpoint; that is the
> +helper's job. As usual, a missing -o subtype=/fsname= defaults the subtype to
> +the program's basename.
> +
> +
> +Requesting backing files and block devices
> +-------------------------------------------
> +
> +Because the sandbox cannot open files, the server asks the helper to open them
> +and send back the descriptor. This is a two-step request/receive pattern (see
> +single_file_service_open() in example/single_file.c):
> +
> +    /* ask the helper to open it */
> +    fuse_service_request_file(service, path, open_flags, create_mode, flags);
> +    /* or, for a block device: */
> +    fuse_service_request_blockdev(service, path, open_flags, create_mode,
> +                                  flags, block_size);
> +
> +    /* then collect the descriptor */
> +    int fd;
> +    fuse_service_receive_file(service, path, &fd);
> +
> +A block_size of 0 leaves the block size of the device unchanged.
> +
> +On success fd is a valid descriptor. A negative fd is a (negated) errno from
> +the helper's open attempt — single_file.c uses this to downgrade an O_RDWR
> +request to O_RDONLY when the backing store is read-only. Pass
> +FUSE_SERVICE_REQUEST_FILE_QUIET in the request flags to suppress the helper's
> +error message when a failure is expected.
> +
> +The helper opens only a path that the mount command line names or that a
> +service_open_path line in /etc/fuse.conf lists, and compares the strings
> +exactly; any other path gets fd == -EPERM. Request the path as the user wrote
> +it, not a canonicalized or rebuilt form. A relative path resolves against the
> +directory mount was run in.
> +
> +Once you have every descriptor you need, close the door on further fd passing:
> +
> +    fuse_service_finish_file_requests(service);
> +
> +This tells the kernel to reject any additional descriptors on the socket
> +(via SO_PASSRIGHTS where available), so a compromised or malicious helper
> +cannot smuggle in more fds afterwards.
> +
> +
> +Capability negotiation
> +----------------------
> +
> +During the handshake the helper advertises what it is willing to do. Query it
> +before relying on those behaviours:
> +
> +    fuse_service_can_allow_other(service)   /* may honour -o allow_other */
> +    fuse_service_can_fuseblk(service)       /* may mount a fuseblk filesystem */
> +
> +
> +Mounting
> +--------
> +
> +fuservicemount3 mounts on a directory or on a regular file, and the kernel
> +gives the filesystem root the type of the mountpoint. Every access to the
> +root fails with EIO when the root your server reports has a different type.
> +To make fuservicemount3 refuse such a mountpoint before it mounts, pass the
> +type of your root (S_IFDIR or S_IFREG):
> +
> +    fuse_service_expect_mount_format(service, S_IFDIR);
> +
> +This call is optional. Without it, fuservicemount3 does not check the root
> +type. A low-level server can instead pass the type as the third argument of
> +fuse_service_session_mount().
> +
> +High-level API — hand off to fuse_service_main(), which builds the operations,
> +performs the mount, and runs the loop:
> +
> +    ret = fuse_service_main(service, &args, &my_oper, NULL);
> +
> +Low-level API — create the session, install signal handlers, then mount:
> +
> +    se = fuse_session_new(&args, &my_ll_oper, sizeof(my_ll_oper), NULL);
> +    ...
> +    fuse_set_signal_handlers(se);
> +
> +    if (fuse_service_session_mount(service, se, S_IFDIR, &opts))
> +        goto error;
> +
> +    fuse_session_loop(se);          /* or fuse_session_loop_mt(se, config) */
> +
> +fuse_service_session_mount() binds the session to the passed /dev/fuse fd and
> +asks the helper to mount the filesystem. It forces foreground operation and
> +chdir("/") so you do not need (and must not) call fuse_daemonize(). After it
> +returns successfully the kernel is already routing requests to your server, so
> +enter your event loop promptly.
> +
> +
> +Shutdown
> +--------
> +
> +Tell the helper you are leaving, releasing and destroying the service context:
> +
> +    fuse_service_send_goodbye(service, exitcode);   /* report exit status */
> +    fuse_service_release(service);                  /* free socket-side state */
> +    ...
> +    fuse_service_destroy(&service);                 /* free the context */
> +
> +    return fuse_service_exit(ret);                  /* map ret to an exit code */
> +
> +In the examples, send_goodbye is sent once mounting has succeeded and the loop
> +is about to start, and again on the error paths; fuse_service_exit() at the end
> +of main() converts the server's return value into the exit status systemd
> +expects. fuse_service_destroy() takes a pointer to the pointer and clears it.

> +The systemd units

> +Ship two units per filesystem, named after the subtype (the part after

> +
> +  myfs.socket    — the listening socket. It must use SOCK_SEQPACKET, accept

> +                   socket directory under the subtype name. The example
> +                   socket file is processed by meson, which substitutes the

> +.SH FILESYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
> +This is not a transparent wrapper for arbitrary FUSE programs. Only a
> +filesystem whose server is written to the libfuse service API can be mounted
> +this way. A conventional server calls \fBfuse_main\fP(3), which opens
> +\fI/dev/fuse\fP and performs the mount itself. The service sandbox does not

> +asks the helper to open any backing files or block devices on its behalf,
> +because its sandbox has no direct filesystem access; and
> +.IP \- 2
> +lets the helper perform the mount, staying in the foreground under systemd.

> +.SS "What it is for"
> +\fIservice_ll\fP exports a single file or block device as a one-file
> +filesystem. Running it as a service keeps the server inside a systemd sandbox
> +\(em its own unprivileged user, private namespaces, and no capabilities \(em
> +while still letting a permitted user mount it with an ordinary \fBmount\fP
> +command. The privileged work (opening the backing device and performing the
> +mount) is done only by the setuid \fBfuservicemount3\fP helper. The
> +same recipe applies to any server written with the libfuse service API.
> +.SS "Setting up the service (administrator, once)"
> +The source for this example ships with the libfuse distribution in its
> +\fIexample\fP directory: \fIservice_ll.c\fP together with its helper
> +\fIsingle_file.c\fP make up the server, and \fIservice_ll@.service\fP and
> +\fIservice_ll.socket\fP are its systemd units. From that directory, build the
> +server and install the binary on the root filesystem:

>  Perform setup of the FUSE file descriptor and mounting the file system before launching the FUSE file system process. \fBmount.fuse3\fP requires privilege to do so, i.e. must be run as root or at least with \fBCAP_SYS_ADMIN\fP and \fBCAP_SETPCAP\fP. It will launch the file system process fully unprivileged, i.e. without \fBcapabilities\fP(7) and \fBprctl\fP(2) flags set up such that privileges can't be reacquired (e.g. via setuid or fscaps binaries). This reduces risk in the event of the FUSE file system process getting compromised by malicious file system data. Because the file system program is launched after privileges have been dropped, it and the libraries it links against must reside at a path the unprivileged process can resolve: every directory component must be searchable without elevated privileges.
